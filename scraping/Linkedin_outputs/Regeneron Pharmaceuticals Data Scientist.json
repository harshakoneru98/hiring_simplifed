The post holder will work closely with other teams in the Regeneron Genetics Center and Regeneron at large. Primary responsibilities will be to design, contribute to the execution of and interpret large and complex human genetic studies. Goals of the team are to apply human genetics and the mining of health databases to therapeutic target discovery, therapeutic target validation, identification of biomarkers of target engagement, selection of indications for drug programs, and precision medicine applications.\nRequirements\n MD with strong background in and profound knowledge of human genetics or genetic epidemiology. An outstanding candidate will be an MD/PhD with training and experience in translational human genetics, genetic epidemiology (or related disciplines) and strong quantitative skills. Demonstrated ability to design and lead human genetics studies delivering medically-relevant findings in a team-based environment. Ability to use medical knowledge to define relevant phenotypes for genetic association studies and to formulate innovative and important research questions. Familiarity with clinical genetics concepts and various genetic models of disease. Experience leading complex human genetics research endeavors. Knowledge of different study designs and analyses including GWAS, exome or genome sequencing in cohort, case-control or family-based studies. Ability to integrate different data resources to translate initial findings. An outstanding candidate will have experience with the use of genetics in combination with other “omics” technologies (eg. metabolomics, proteomics, RNA-seq). Familiarity with the applications of statistical genetics to gain medically-actionable insights including polygenic risk scores, quantitative traits analyses and Mendelian randomization. Familiarity with command line interface, programming languages and statistical software (eg. Python, R, STATA). Interest in understanding the genetic basis and causes of human diseases and translating this knowledge into therapeutic insights. An outstanding candidate will have previous experience with large-scale data mining for therapeutic target identification in specific therapeutic areas or across therapeutic areas.
